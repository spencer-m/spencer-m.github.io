					The Android Application is developed for the Software Engineering Course. First of all, we have to choose what application we would like to do which is tied to a customer group. Then, we would ask them what they want the app to do, which is our requirements gathering. From here, we have also decided to do the agile methodology for the project. We have chosen this because of the flexibility it provides in our development process. The customer involvement is also a desirable feature of the methodology as it gives us feedback on the look, feel and capabilites of the app. After our requirements gathering, our customers have given us five functional requirements for the app. These are:
					<ul>
						<li>The calculation of calories required to be taken by the user</li>
						<li>Keeping track of the user's calorie intake</li>
						<li>Keeping track of the user's Water Intake</li>
						<li>A database with the calorie count of common foods</li>
						<li>An end of day comparison for the calories consumed</li>
					</ul>
					These requirements, with the exception of the last one, were then implemented to the app. In order to do this, we first started on doing a story map, low fidelity protptyping, storyboarding and use case scenarios to base our app onto. Our planning consisted of Poker Effort Estimation method so that we could distribute the workload of the project to the group member who can do it efficiently. We did our test using the Test-Driven Development Approach. And finally, in order to document our app, we used Structural and Behavioral modelling. These include UML diagrams the represent our app and sequence diagrams that describe important use case scenarios. After all of these, we then presented our android application to the semester-end presentation session where other groups also presented. It was a fun project to do because I get to learn how the software development process works.

					The game is developed as an assignment for the Computing Machinery II course. We used ARM Assembly to create this game for the Raspberry Pi Model B. The JTAG interface was used for flashing and debugging the program. A driver has to be made for the SNES controller the Raspberry Pi is interfaced with. On the course of the game development, we learned how to use the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, how the interrupt works and how hardware and software "talk" to each other at the low level. In the end, the resulting program is a TRON inspired Snake game which looks and plays really good.
