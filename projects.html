					Web-Based Systems taught me the basics of web-based systems (including relevant technologies and programming languages) 
					not only in the classroom, but through a semester-long group project intended to educate us in the design and creation of 
					web applications. The aforementioned web application had to fulfill the following list of requirements:
					<br><br>
					<ol>
						<li>Client-side Component</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Majority of your application's functionality must be accessible through a single-page interface.</li>
							<li>Your client side must be implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies.</li>
							<li>You are allowed to use any open source libraries in your implementation.</li>
							<li>Your application must run in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on desktop, and at least one mobile browser.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Mobile support Component</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Your application must be usable on mobile devices.</li>
							<li>You can choose one of the following mobile strategies: mobile friendly or mobile first.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Server-side Component</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Most of the "business logic" should be performed on the server.</li>
							<li>You should think of the client side as the GUI frontend for the server component.</li>
							<li>In order to achieve this requirement, your implementation will have to rely on heavy use of JavaScript, combined with asynchronous communication with the server via Ajax or WebSockets technologies.</li>
							<li>The server-side must be implemented using Node.js.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Multiple Users Requirement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Your application must support multiple simultaneous users.</li>
							<li>Your application should implement at least a very basic user authentication.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Persistence Requirement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Your application needs to demonstrate persistence capabilites.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>User Interaction Requirement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Users must be able to interact with other users of the system.</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					In order to build a web app that meets all the requirements, we decided to do a combination of a learning 
					management system (e.g. Desire2Learn) and a classroom interaction tool (e.g. Tophat). The result is a web app 
					focusing both on a modern, streamlined access to course materials and a welcoming environment for students to 
					pose questions.
					<br><br>
					Each team member was assigned a specific section of the web application to develop. We held weekly meetings 
					to monitor each team member's progress. I was in charge of the Login and Registration pages as well as most 
					of the backend tasks such as the database operations and setting up and designing the Node server.
					<br><br>
					Our web application used a lot of the technologies we learned in class, as well as technologies that we searched 
					for that fit our needs. For the framework, we utilized Node.js and Express. For the frontend, we implemented it 
					using JQuery, Bootstrap, connect-flash and EJS. For the bidirectional data transfer, we used a WebSockets library 
					called socket.io. For our authentication, we implemented it using Passport.js. Finally, for our NoSQL database, 
					we used MongoDB and Mongoose.

					<center><b><i>A project for the Human-Computer Interactions Course</i></b></center>
					<br>
					At the start of the course, our team decided to develop a recreation centre app. 
					We chose this project because we wanted to explore the idea of making a mobile application that 
					improves upon the services that the website of the University of Calgary Recreation Centre provides. 
					The project consisted of four parts. These parts include user research, ideation and creation of 
					lo-fi prototypes, formulation of a hi-fi prototype and conducting of heuristic evaluations, 
					and presentation and demonstration.
					<br><br>
					The first part was user research where we gathered data from our potential users for our recreation centre app.
					We used some the IDEO methods for collecting this data. The methods we used were Fly on the Wall, surveys and questionnaires, 
					and the synthesis of character profiles. We observed people's interactions while in the recreation facilities and 
					identified our target users using Fly on the Wall. The surveys and questionnaires allowed us to interview and ask 
					questions from our user base. This included questions such as <i>which facilities do they usually use</i> and <i>what features 
					do they look for in a recreation centre app</i>. Finally, after collecting all these information, we utilized character 
					profiles to help us build our app that would work well with our target audience.
					<br><br>
					Next, the second section of the project involved ideation and making of the low fidelity prototypes. 
					We brainstormed ideas and had an affinity diagram session where we refined those ideas. We also created a 
					storyboard and a video prototype to help visualize our app. The final design was tested by using a task-centered 
					system walkthrough where we tried to simulate different tasks using the design we created.
					<br><br>
					The third part of the project was to create the high fidelity prototype. We used Android Studio and GitHub 
					as tools to build the prototype. The app features a calendar and a new menu system. The calendar enables the 
					user to manage bookings and also grabs information from the user's Google calendar. The new menu system allows 
					the user to access the menu conveniently with either hand. After building the app, we conducted a heuristic 
					evaluation to analyze its usability. This ensured that our application met the standards of usability of our users.
					<br><br>
					Finally, the last section of the project was to present our findings and demonstrate our high fidelity prototype. 
					In the presentation, we showcased our findings we obtained throughout the project. Based on the heuristic evaluation, 
					we delivered recommendations on how to improve the usability of the recreation centre app.

					<center><b><i>An Android Application developed for the Software Engineering Course</i></b></center>
					<br>
					First of all, we chose what application we would like to create based on a customer group. Then, to fulfill 
					our requirements gathering, we asked them for their expected features for the app. From here, we decided to do 
					the agile methodology for the project. We chose this because of the flexibility it provided in our development 
					process. Customer involvement was also a desirable feature of the methodology as it gave us feedback on the look, 
					feel and capabilites of the app. After our requirements gathering, our customers gave us five functional 
					requirements for the app. These are:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>The calculation of calories required to be taken by the user</li>
						<li>Keeping track of the user's calorie intake</li>
						<li>Keeping track of the user's water intake</li>
						<li>A database with the calorie count of common foods</li>
						<li>An end of day comparison for the calories consumed</li>
					</ul>
					These requirements, with the exception of the last one, were then implemented to the app. In order to do this, 
					we first started on formulating a story map, low fidelity protptyping, storyboarding and use case scenarios to 
					base our app onto. Our planning consisted of the Poker Effort Estimation method so that we could distribute the 
					workload of the project in terms of tasks to the group member who can do it efficiently. We executed our tests 
					using the Test-Driven Development Approach. And finally, in order to document our app, we used Structural and 
					Behavioral modelling. These included UML diagrams which represented our app and sequence diagrams that described 
					important use case scenarios. GitLab was the platform used for version control. Once we finished these steps, 
					we - along with other groups - presented our android application in a semester-end presentation session. 
					It was an enriching project because I was able to learn how the software development process works.

					<center><b><i>A game developed as an assignment for the Computing Machinery II course</i></b><br></center>
					<br>
					We used ARM Assembly and the Raspberry Pi Model B to create this game. We used the JTAG interface for flashing 
					and debugging the program. The program itself relies on an SNES controller; however, the driver for this peripheral 
					was made from scratch. On the course of the game development, we learned how to use the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi, 
					how the interrupt works and how hardware and software "talk" to each other at the low level. Furthermore, we learned 
					more about source control. In the end, the resulting program is a TRON inspired Snake game with decent graphics 
					and engaging gameplay.

					<br>
					This project was announced early in the semester. We started with proposal creation. From our proposal, we created 
					an ER diagram to represent the database the user would manage. This ER diagram underwent many revisions throughout 
					our planning stage. Along with the ER diagram, we made a Hierarchical Input Process Output (HIPO) model and 
					Data Flow Diagrams (DPD). With everything ready, we went ahead and started coding the Database Management System (DBMS). 
					Our languages of choice were mySQL, PHP and JavaScript. We used mySQL Workbench, WAMP/MAMP and BitBucket as our 
					tools to make the project. My main role in the project was handling PHP and mySQL. At the conclusion of the project, 
					we composed a Medical Clinic DBMS that implements these features:
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Login System for Doctors, Employees and Patients</li>
						<li>Patient Calendar</li>
						<li>Patient Scheduler</li>
						<li>Doctor Appointment Management</li>
						<li>Inventory Management</li>
						<li>Supplies Management</li>
						<li>Billing Management</li>
						<li>Drug Management</li>

					<center><b><i>A Hitachi-sponsored hackathon that lasted for two days</i></b> <br></center>
					<br>
					The hackathon's theme was "First World Problems". Later on in the first day was when we thought about which 
					first world problem we should tackle. After an hour of brainstorming and discussion, we settled on the problem of 
					many gamers: <i>"How do I play with players that has a similar play style and skill level as me?"</i> That is the 
					basis of our app that we call the Friend Finder App. Now that we knew where we were heading, we set out to learn 
					developing apps for the Android platform. Take note that this is our first hackathon and we have not made a single 
					Android app before. We also tried doing version control, such as Git, but we moved on to do doing file transfers 
					because we could not get Git working and we were running out of time. Our Day 1 ended with a working skeleton for our app.
					The next day we decided to start early. We kept learning about new things about the Android platform. As I worked on 
					the framework and the interface, my groupmates were working on the data structure, test database and visuals. At the 
					end of the day, the app was 75% complete. Finally, early on Day 3, we finished up our app by improving the visuals, 
					polishing the rough edges and preparing for our presentation.
